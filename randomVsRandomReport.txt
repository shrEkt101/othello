RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?

The second player seems to have a slight edge (about 5%) over the first player.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

Analytically computing the validity of the correlation presented in the data
could be overly complicated. Sometimes simply using brute force to simulate them and
calculating the likelihood of the original correlation is easier and more intuitive.

4) H0 is that the second player is no more likely to win the game and the second player
won more frequently than the first by pure chance.

5) Ha is that the second player is that the second player is more likely to win.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0

Through direct simulation, I argue that my experimental results support the Ha.
I simulated game of othello 10000 times with both players playing random moves.
Whenever there was a draw, I made them rematch until there was a winner to simplify the calculation.
The calculated edge P2 had over was approximately 5% after 10000 trials.

Recall that H0 is that the game is fair, or that P2 has no edge over P2 (equivalently, P2Win% - P1Win% > 0%).
I then ran a simulation of 10000*1000 coin flips (which have probability 0.5 of p1 or p2),
and for every 1000 flips, I incremented the Ha counter if P2Win% - P1Win% >= 5%.
The simulation concluded that the probability given the H0 of P2 having an edge of over 5% was 5.77%,
which I believe is quite unlikely. Moreover, this is similar to the theoretical value calculated when using
a binomial distribution (p=0.5, n=1000), P(X>=525) = 6.06%.
Hence, the game of othello favors the second player.
